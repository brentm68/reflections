What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 
	metadata is created for the directory that tracks files and history. without initializing, 
	git does not know that this is a git repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do 
you think it offers? 

	staging area holds all of the chagnes that will happen at the next commit. working 
	directory and repository are basically the same and hold all of the files that are 
	tracked.  staging area can be cleared to revert changes? 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How
would branches help?
	
	changes to code, but want to keep the original. experimental features. 
	branches make a second copy that can be modified and tracked apart from the master.
