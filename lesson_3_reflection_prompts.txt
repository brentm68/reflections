When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    to share with other developers or to keep a backup on a remote location. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    a change on github may overwrite a change on the local repository. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    a fork is a copy of a repository that continues without effecting the original. 
    clone is a copy of the repo that can effect the original. 
    branch is a split off of the original with a new label and new commit line. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    if changes are made to the remote before your local changes are merged
	you would want to review those changes to make sure that they don't
	overwrite your changes, or your changes overwrite the remote changes. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    we could send files back and forth, or some kind of screen sharing, or some kind of
	colaboration group chat type deal.  sending files back and forth would be hardest, 
	screen sharing would be easier, but easiest with group chat and screen sharing and
	github. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
